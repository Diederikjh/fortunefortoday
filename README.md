# fortunefortoday
Small JS client side website with jQuery andbootstrap to show fortune cookies.
See http://fortunefortoday.com/ for it in action!

Originally written on a whim in 2009 - when php was still cool.  Some API rot forced me to find a new fortune SOAP Webservice in 2011 and again in 2014.

DNS service provider move in 2017 caused the move to AWS Lambda backend for cookie retrieval, and the move to more modern libs.

Most feedback will be read, and may be acted upon.
